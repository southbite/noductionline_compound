## Current goal: smooth integration with template engines

Views accessible as compiled functions in `railway.structure.views` collection.
Probably this is overengineered part. And it should be just collection of
filenames, to work with express 3.x view engine.

Revise block-dependent helpers such as formFor and fieldsFor, disable when
templating engine is not jade/ejs.

## Upcoming development

### Structure API

Expose views/controllers/helpers/models as replaceable parts of `railway.structure` hash.

### Controllers without eval

It should be possible to use pure controllers with no eval-magic. With ability
to inherit controllers and use any controller package, not only kontroller.

### CASE-sensitivity in model/crud generators
